# Spotify Popularity Prediction

This repository is composed of two datasets, a jupyter notebook and a README.

Both datasets have informations concerning songs uploaded on the platform Spotify : name, danceability, loudness etc.
- The first dataset shows popularity using a boolean. 
- The second dataset uses a scale from 0 to 100 to convey popularity.

In the Notebook, we'll use each dataset to work with regression and classification models to try and predict songs' popularity.
